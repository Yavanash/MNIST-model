# MNIST Classification using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits (0-9) using a dataset structured similarly to MNIST. The model is trained using PyTorch and includes data augmentation with Albumentations.

## 📌 Features
- **Dataset Handling**: Loads and preprocesses images from a structured dataset.
- **Data Augmentation**: Uses Albumentations for transformations.
- **Model Architecture**: A simple CNN with two convolutional layers and batch normalization.
- **Training & Validation**: Implements training and evaluation loops with accuracy and loss tracking.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Computes accuracy and displays a confusion matrix.

## 📂 Dataset Structure
Your dataset should be structured as follows:
```
data/
│── training/
│   ├── 0/  (Images of digit 0)
│   ├── 1/
│   ├── ...
│   ├── 9/
│── testing/
│   ├── 0/
│   ├── 1/
│   ├── ...
│   ├── 9/
```

## 🛠 Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:
```sh
pip install torch torchvision numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn albumentations scikit-learn tqdm opencv-python
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the training script:
```sh
python train.py
```

### **Training & Validation**
The script trains the CNN for **25 epochs** and prints the loss for each epoch.

### **Evaluation**
After training, the script computes the accuracy and generates a confusion matrix.

## 📊 Results
- The model achieves high accuracy on digit classification.
- The confusion matrix provides insight into misclassified digits.

## 💾 Model Saving & Loading
The trained model weights are saved as:
```sh
model_weights.pth
```
To load and use the trained model:
```python
import torch
model = torch.load("model.pth")
model.eval()
```

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced CNN architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet).
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Train on additional datasets to improve generalization.
